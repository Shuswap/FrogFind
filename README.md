# Mobilizer

Forked from FrogFind. Parts of the FrogFind code can be used to mobilize websites in the manner of the old Google Mobilizer and Google Web Light by adding a prefix to the URL.

Install this code on your webserver and append http://yourserver.tld/yourdirectory/read.php/?a= in front of an address and the content will be "mobilized."

This code contains the modifications made here so that you don't have to install it in a root directory: https://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind/pull/3 by @ndunand

See this thread for valuable information on installation: https://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind/issues/1
