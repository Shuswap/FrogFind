# Mobilizer

Forked from FrogFind. Parts of the FrogFind code can be used to mobilize websites in the manner of the old Google Mobilizer, Google Web Light, Skweezer, and mlvb.net by adding a prefix to the URL.

Install this code on your webserver and append http://yourserver.tld/yourdirectory/read.php/?a= in front of an address and the content will be "mobilized."

This code contains the modifications made by @ndunand so that you don't have to install it in a root directory: https://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind/pull/3

See this thread for valuable information on installation: https://github.com/ActionRetro/FrogFind/issues/1
